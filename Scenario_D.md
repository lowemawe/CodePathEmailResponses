Thank you for getting in touch with us.

Please note that CodePath strictly follows its [coursework policies](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19) and we encourage our students to do the same to ensure a better learning experience.

At CodePath, we make sure to provide advance notice and want to ensure our students are heard. If there is non-compliance with our course policy, such as missing coursework, we typically ask students to explain the reason for the missing work via email or Slack. Students are given the rest of the day to respond; if no reply is received, they will be withdrawn from the course.

We appreciate your willingness to address the missed work. However, despite our attempts to reach you via email and Slack regarding your missing coursework, we did not receive a response.

**You will still have lifetime access to the course materials through the GitHub account you used to sign up.**
