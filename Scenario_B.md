**Hello Jane,**

Thank you for reaching us and expressing your interest. 

Currently, our courses are tailored for students at our partner universities in the United States. However, we have intentions of extending our scope and are already operating programs in other countries, like Haiti. We aim to expand further in the future.

In the meantime, we highly encourage you to join our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) to stay updated on our new courses and to be informed when classes become available in your region, either through local organizers or online.

We look forward to the possibility of bringing our programs to your area soon and expanding our audience. Thank you for your understanding.

*For further questions and concerns, please don't hesitate to email us at admissions@codepath.org.* 

With kind regards,
**CodePath.org Team**
